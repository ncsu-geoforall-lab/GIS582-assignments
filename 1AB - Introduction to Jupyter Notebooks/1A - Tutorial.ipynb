    "Notebooks are increasingly popular among data analysts, data scientists, programmers, and scientists (check out [this Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1)). For example, [this data science tutorial](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-vector-data-python/spatial-data-vector-shapefiles/) was created from a notebook. Or, check out [this Master's-level course on Geospatial Data Analysis](https://uwgda-jupyterbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) that entirely notebook-based (even the website is created from notebooks!). Even academic journals like [AGU](https://agu.curve.space/) are starting to introduce a notebook format so that notebooks can be submitted as a standalone journal articles. **Notebooks are a great way to develop and document your workflow, make your work reproducible and to share your work with others.**"

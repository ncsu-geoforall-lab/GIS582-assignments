# GIS582 Assignment Notebooks

Welcome to GIS582 from the GeoForAll Lab at North Carolina State University.

Course website: [https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/index.html](https://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/index.html)

This repo contains tutorials and assignments formated as Jupyter Notebooks designed to accompany the GIS582 Geospatial Modeling and Analysis course.

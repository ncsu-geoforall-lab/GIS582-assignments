    "Following the results of the two sections of Assignment 2, write a paper that describes geospatial data models conversions (e.g., changing raster resolution, raster to vector and vector to raster) methods and results. Also explain methods and results for graphical representation of continuous and discrete geospatial data. Demonstrate the use of 3D perspective views for highlighting topographic features and relationships between elevation surface and land use / land cover (Optional if you used the notebooks). Make sure to answer all questions in the assignments and include all images saved with d.out.file in the GRASS part, use your judgement to decide which images to include from ArcGIS Pro outputs (optional). Optionally, include 3D views of multiple surfaces for visual analysis of the difference between the bare ground surface and multiple return surface with vegetation.\n"
